The Chadabase serves as a compilation database for FRC Competitions.  It gets its unique name from the original programmer, Chad (last name).

Team 701 Develops and uses the Chadabase along with RoboEI to record and compile data on FRC teams at every competition.

The Chadabase is strictly developed for use with RoboEI, and changes every year to meet the needs of the newly released competition.
